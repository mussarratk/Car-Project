  - model’s accuracy is below the required threshold, improving it should be your immediate focus.
  -  optimizing the model’s performance might be crucial, but if the current version meets the project’s needs, you can schedule this task for later.
automating data pipelines or model retraining processes can significantly reduce your manual workload.

- Model versioning is crucial for tracking updates and allows for quick rollbacks to previous versions if the new version underperforms in production
- Version control is crucial for managing deployments, ensuring that the correct version of a model is deployed and allowing easy rollback if necessary.

In the machine learning context, joblib is frequently used with scikit-learn to save and load trained models. This is because scikit-learn models often contain large NumPy arrays.
